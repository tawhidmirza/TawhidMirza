## About me

Hello, I'm Mirza MD Tawhid , an enthusiastic graduate student with a strong interest in s software quality testing and software quality assurance. I'm on a mission to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

I am quick lerner and has good communication skills.

Right now, I'm really focused on learning about software testing. I'm  trying out different tools by testing websites made for practice.

I'm excited to put what I've learned into action by testing real products. This hands-on experience is super important for my goal of becoming a mid-level software tester in the next two years.

__Manual testing__
  * can perform Black Box Testing, SDLC, STLC, Testing Levels, Testing Method and Stages.
  * gained hands-on experience by testing applications created for Cyber-100

__Black Box Testing__
* Black Box testing is like solving a puzzle without knowing how it works inside.
* You check if the software does what it's supposed to do without peeking into its internal workings.
* It's all about testing from a user's perspective, focusing on what the software does rather than how it's built.
* This method helps find bugs and errors by simulating real user interactions, ensuring the software behaves as expected.
